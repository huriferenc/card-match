    In turn, each player chooses two cards and turns them face up. If they are of the same number
    then that player wins the pair and plays again. If they are not of the same number, they are
    turned face down again and play passes to the player on the left.

    The game ends when the last pair has been picked up. The winner is the person with the most
    pairs. There may be a tie for first place.
